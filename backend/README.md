# About

Web application using MERN stack.
***
* MongoDB Atlas is used for our cloud database storage.

***
# Setup

1. Ensure you have NodeJS installed. Run `node --version` to check for the version.

2. In both the server and client directory, run `npm ci` to have a clean installation of all dependencies required for frontend and backend.

3. Get the .env file from Clarence. Ensure that you have the .env file in the `/server/` directory. This file contains the necessary environment variables.

# Running the application

1. To launch server normally, run `npm start`. To launch client, run `npm start`.

2. To launch server in dev mode, run `npm run dev`. This will allow changes to be made at runtime for ease of debugging.

3. Local client is available at `http://localhost:3000`. Local server is available at `http://localhost:8080`.

# Backend testing

1. Download the latest version of Postman from `https://www.postman.com/downloads/`

2. Use Postman to send out CRUD requests to our API server `http://localhost:8080` locally.
